<h1>Common Questions</h1>
<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
<p>Bearcat Exchange is completely free. Seriously, it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<h3>I&rsquo;m in a rush. How long will it take to get my textbook?</h3>
<p>
    Sellers are independent so we can&rsquo;t control how long they&rsquo;ll take, but
    they want your money and you want their textbook.
</p>
<h3>Can I search for textbooks by course?</h3>
<p>
    Yep, you can search by any part of listings via the search bar on the top of the
    screen.
</p>
<h3>How do I remove or edit my textbook?</h3>
<p>
    Click the <a href="/account/" class="spaLoad">edit your listings</a> tab. Once
    you're logged in you can click the "sold" checkbox to the left of the item you want
    to remove. The item will turn grey and will no longer be visible to anyone else.
    Alternatively, you could click on the item and edit any part of it. If you're on a
    shared computer make sure you <a onclick="logout()">logout</a> once you finish.
</p>
<h3>How do I create an account?</h3>
<p>
    You don't. Instead of storing a password we just send you an email with a
    confirmation link if you want to edit your items.
</p>
<h3>
    You asked for my name and email, but I don&rsquo;t want them on the internet...
</h3>
<p>
    Your information is safe with us. When buyers contact you they can&rsquo;t see your
    email address because their message is sent through our server. A buyer will only
    see your email if you <i>reply</i> to their message to arrange a time to meet. If
    something seems odd, don&rsquo;t reply. Additionally, since the message goes through
    our server we filter spam before it&rsquo;s ever even sent! Best of all, once you
    mark your textbook as sold, no one else will be able to contact you, unlike normal
    email which stays in the wild forever.
</p>
<h3>Will you send me unwanted messages?</h3>
<p>
    Nope, we only use your email to send alerts, such as when someone contacts you. You
    can also optionally subscribe to our super cool newsletter, which is only sent a few
    times a year and always has an unsubscribe link at the bottom.
</p>

<h3>Do you take suggestions?</h3>
<p>

    <a href="/feedback/" class="spaLoad">feedback form</a> and let us know about them.
</p>
